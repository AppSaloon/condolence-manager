This plugin allows visitors to write a message of condolence to the family of the deceased and register to attend the coffee table.

== Description ==
This plugin is made especially for funeral directors.
It\'s an online tool to give friends and family the opportunity to show their support to relatives of the deceased.

You can create a post with info and image about the  deseaded and add an obituary to this post.
You can determine which fields are displayed in the frontend and in what order.
Webvisotors can offer one\'s condolence on this obituary notice and can register to attend the coffee table.

The funeral director needs to approve the condolences before the family can read and comment. Registers are send by mail to the familie of the deceased.
The family is informed by mail when a new condolence is approved and comments on this condolence are send to the mailadres of the person who gave his condolence.
The plugin generates a unique url where only the family can view these condolences.
