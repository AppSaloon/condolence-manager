This plugin allows visitors to condole the family of the deceased.

== Description ==
This plugin is made especially for funeral directors.
It\'s an online tool to give friends and family the opportunity to show their support to relatives of the deceased.

You can create a post with info and image about the  deseaded and add an obituary to this post. You can determine which fields are displayed in the frontend and in what order.
Webvisotors can offer one\'s condolence on this obituary notice.
